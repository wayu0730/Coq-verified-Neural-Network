# Coq-verified-Neural-Network
This repository is to use Coq to verify that a 3-layer neural network satisfies the Lipschitz restriction.

## Introduction
Neural networks are a powerful machine learning technique that have shown excellent performance in a wide range of applications. However, their complex structure and non-linear behavior make them difficult to analyze and verify. Formal verification is a method for ensuring the correctness of software systems using mathematical methods. In this project, I have implemented a neural network in Coq and used formal verification techniques to prove its correctness.

Getting Started
To use the Coq-verified neural network, you will need to have Coq installed on your system. Coq can be downloaded from the official website: https://coq.inria.fr/download.

You can start CoqIDE by typing the command `coqide` in the terminal.
Once CoqIDE is launched, you can import your Coq file by selecting "File" and then "Open" from the menu bar, and then browsing your file system to locate the Coq file you want to import. Select the file and click "Open" to import it into CoqIDE.
